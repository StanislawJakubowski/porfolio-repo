        <div class="column-text ">
            After many years spent in the pharmaceutical industry as a medical representative, 
            I came back to my unfulfilled interest â€“ programming. My goal is to become a professional
            developer within the next few years. To achieve this, I started with completion of extended
            Web JAVA Developer course at IT Coders Lab School. 
            Currently I am looking for a chance to work in commercial JAVA projects. 
            Despite the lack of commercial experience, I believe through the compilation of hard work, 
            motivation and technical background I will bring quick value to engaged projects.
